# Synopsis Of The Project
## 1. Abstract:
In the contemporary landscape of the digital world, where industry rely on the technology of artificial intelligence which fundamentally depends on the concepts of machine learning. Machine learning is a field where it utilizes the immense amount data and then feed this data into a structure called as models. This data “trains” this model. Abundant data is used to train these models, for this data to be as accurate as it can be optimally.
However, reliance on this abundant data exposes us to a significant risk to user privacy which are a matter of a concern. It directly challenges the existence of  “right to be forgotten”. There is an intricate relation between the model and the data that it is trained with. Traditional data management systems can easily erase user information from databases, but the scenario becomes considerably complex with machine learning models. This gives rise to the whole new concept called machine unlearning.
This project addresses this challenge by developing a standalone tool and API specifically designed to facilitate the forgetting of data by machine learning models. Our objective is to pioneer a practical approach to enhance user privacy in the context of machine learning technologies. By creating an efficient and reliable solution, we aim to bridge the gap between data privacy rights and the intricate workings of machine learning models. Through this endeavour, we contribute to the evolving discourse on privacy, data security, and ethical AI practices in the digital age.

## 2. Problem Statement:
A machine learning model is trained with immense data. This data stays with the machine learning model. The retention of the data with the model pose a significant privacy risk. If a machine learning model is compromised we will also risk exposing the trained data.

## 3. Objective And Scope Of The Project:
A Machine Unlearning project aims to develop techniques and methodologies for a machine learning model to selectively forget or update previously learned information. The objectives and scope of such a project typically include:
* Selective Forgetting: To design algorithms such that it allows the model to selectively forget specific information while retaining relevant knowledge in the model.

*	Ethical Consideration: To address the issue where the forgetting of the knowledge gained by the model through the data does not involve any discriminatory and biased behaviour.

*	Security and Privacy: To investigate potential vulnerabilities introduced by unlearning processes, and design safeguards to prevent unauthorized or malicious attempts to manipulate the model's knowledge.
*	User Interaction: To explore interfaces or mechanisms through which users or administrators can guide the unlearning process, providing feedback or constraints on what information should be forgotten.
*	Benchmark Datasets and Environments: To create standardized datasets and environments for testing and benchmarking machine unlearning techniques, ensuring reproducibility and comparability across different research efforts.
*	Real-world Deployment: To consider practical challenges in deploying machine unlearning in production systems, including issues related to scalability, adaptability to specific tasks, and integration with existing machine learning workflows.

## 4. Project Methodology:
To achieve our goal, we'll develop a straightforward tool and API. These tools will use cutting-edge techniques like machine unlearning and federated unlearning. These methods allow the models to forget specific data while retaining their learning, maintaining accuracy without compromising privacy. By implementing these techniques, our solution will provide a practical way to safeguard user information without sacrificing the effectiveness of machine learning models.

## 5. Testing approaches: 
For our project, we will use simple and effective testing methods to ensure everything works as it should.
*	Unit Testing: We'll check individual parts of our tool to make sure they work correctly. It's like testing each ingredient in a recipe before making the whole dish.
*	Integration Testing: We'll test how different parts of our tool work together. This is like making sure all the pieces of a puzzle fit well.
*	User Testing: We'll ask people to use our tool and give us feedback. It's like having others taste your cooking and tell you if it needs more salt or sugar.
*	Security Testing: We'll check if our tool is safe from hackers. This is like making sure your house has good locks to keep intruders out.
These tests will help us make sure our tool is safe, effective, and easy to use.

## 6. Project Contribution:
Our project aims to revolutionize the way machine learning models handle user data, ensuring a significant contribution to the field of data privacy and artificial intelligence. By developing a practical tool and API that allows these models to forget specific data while retaining their accuracy, we address a critical gap in the current technology landscape.
*	Enhanced User Privacy: Our solution provides a robust mechanism for safeguarding user information. By enabling machine learning models to forget sensitive data, we empower individuals with greater control over their digital footprint, aligning with the concept of the "right to be forgotten."
*	Advancing Ethical AI Practices: As ethical concerns around data privacy and AI continue to grow, our project contributes to the development of responsible AI technologies. By promoting ethical practices within machine learning, we pave the way for a more secure and privacy-conscious digital future.
*	Bridging the Gap Between Security and Innovation: Our tool strikes a balance between data security and the innovative potential of machine learning. It allows organizations to harness the power of AI without compromising user privacy, thereby fostering a secure environment for technological advancement.
*	Facilitating Secure Data Sharing: In the realm of federated unlearning, our project facilitates secure data sharing among entities. This encourages collaborative efforts in machine learning research and application, fostering a community-driven approach to innovation.
*	Educational Impact: By addressing a complex technological challenge in a user-friendly manner, our project serves as an educational resource. It enhances understanding of machine unlearning techniques and their practical applications, contributing to the knowledge base of both students and professionals in the field.

In summary, our project's contribution lies in its ability to redefine the way machine learning models handle data, promoting user privacy, ethical AI practices, innovation, secure data sharing, and education within the realm of artificial intelligence.

## 7. Conclusion:
In closing, our project achieved a crucial goal: making sure user data stays private in the world of machine learning. By creating a tool that helps models forget specific data while keeping their accuracy, we've found a balance between technology and privacy. We've shown that AI can be smart and respectful at the same time. Our work opens doors for safer digital experiences, teaching us that with careful design, technology can protect and empower us. This project isn't just an end; it's a beginning, marking a path for ethical and secure AI practices in the future.
