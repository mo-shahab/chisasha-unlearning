  i guess in order to start this concept of machine unlearning we have to start with what is the meaning and the idea behind it.
  i think the first paper written by T. T. Nguyen, T. T. Huynh, P. L. Nguyen, A. W.-C. Liew, H. Yin, and Q. V. H. Nguyen, "A Survey of Machine Unlearning" would be a stepping     stone of this project.
